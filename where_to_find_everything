the important files:

other/nets.py
- contains pooling_aggregator and gru_aggregator, which are used to aggregate unprojected 5d tensors from multiple views
- contains voxel_net_3d_v2, which goes from aggregated features to output voxel prediction

other/unproject.py
- contains most of the logic for unprojection, unproject_and_rotate being high level wrapper you want to use
- rotate_to_first computes rotation matrices for rotating a list of azimuths and elevations to the first one
- also contains project_and_postprocess, which warps feature volumes so that depth axis is aligned with camera rays
- contains flatten

other/test_unproject.py
- demonstration of how to use unproject

models/active_mvnet.py
- _create_ground_truth_voxels shows how to rotate the input gt voxels to gt from a certain viewpoint
